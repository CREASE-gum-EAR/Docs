FormationFlight uses LoRa or ESPNOW to broadcast position, altitude, speed and aircraft name, and listens for other UAVs so your flight controller's OSD can display this information.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/","title":"Getting Started with FormationFlight","text":""},{"location":"getting-started/#connect","title":"Connect","text":"<p>For some boards (ESP dev boards like the Lolin or TTGO series) this can be done with a USB connection.

On ExpressLRS receivers for example, there's a pad marked \"BOOT\". This pad must be connected to ground while power is applied to the board to enter bootloader mode. Once your board is in bootloader mode, continue to the flashing section.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#flash","title":"Flash","text":""},{"location":"getting-started/#install-esp-flasher","title":"Install ESP flasher","text":"<p>You can download an easy to use ESP flasher tool from Jason8266's ESP_Flasher repo.
